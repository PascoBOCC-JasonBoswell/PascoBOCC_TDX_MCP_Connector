# PASCO-TDX-MCP Deployment Guide (Simplified)

Simple, manual deployment of the MCP server to Windows Server 2022 IIS 10 in the DMZ QA environment.

## Overview

Deploy directly from your development machine using a PowerShell script that:
- Builds the project locally
- Connects to the QA server via WinRM
- Copies build artifacts
- Installs dependencies
- Configures IIS
- Starts the Node.js application

No CI/CD pipeline needed - just one script to run when you're ready to deploy.

## Prerequisites

### On Your Development Machine
- [ ] PowerShell 7+ or Windows PowerShell 5.1+
- [ ] Node.js LTS (24.x) installed locally
- [ ] npm installed locally
- [ ] Credentials for the QA DMZ server (domain\username and password)

### On the QA DMZ Server
- [ ] Windows Server 2022 with IIS 10 installed
- [ ] Node.js LTS (24.x or later) installed and in PATH
- [ ] npm available in PATH
- [ ] WinRM enabled: `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`
- [ ] Application directory created: `E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP`
- [ ] Firewall rules:
  - Inbound HTTPS (port 443) from your network
  - WinRM (ports 5985/5986) from your machine's IP
- [ ] Outbound HTTPS access to internal TDX API

### TDX Credentials
Obtain from TDAdmin > Organization Details > API Settings:
- [ ] TDX Web API base URL (e.g., `https://yourorg.teamdynamix.com/TDWebApi/api`)
- [ ] Admin BEID (GUID format)
- [ ] Web Services Key (GUID format)
- [ ] Default Application ID (integer)

## Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare the QA Server (One-Time Setup)

On the QA server, run as Administrator:

```powershell
# Enable WinRM for remote connections
Enable-PSRemoting -Force

# Verify IIS is installed with URL Rewrite
Get-WindowsFeature Web-Server
Get-WindowsFeature Web-Rewrite-Module

# Create application directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP" -Force

# Verify Node.js is installed
node --version
npm --version
```

Checklist:
- [ ] WinRM is enabled
- [ ] IIS 10 is installed
- [ ] URL Rewrite module is installed
- [ ] `E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP` directory exists
- [ ] Node.js 24.x+ is installed
- [ ] Firewall allows WinRM from your machine's IP

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script

From your development machine, in the repository root:

```powershell
# Run the deployment script
.\scripts\deploy-local.ps1
```

You'll be prompted for:
1. QA Server FQDN or IP address
2. DMZ Domain username (DOMAIN\username)
3. DMZ Domain password
4. TDX Base URL
5. TDX BEID
6. TDX Web Services Key
7. TDX App ID

Review the summary and confirm with `yes` to proceed.

**Optional: Pre-populate credentials to skip prompts:**

```powershell
.\scripts\deploy-local.ps1 `
    -QAServer "qa-dmz-server.domain.local" `
    -Username "DOMAIN\serviceaccount" `
    -Password "YourPassword" `
    -TDXBaseUrl "https://yourorg.teamdynamix.com/TDWebApi/api" `
    -TDXBEID "your-beid-guid" `
    -TDXWebServicesKey "your-key-guid" `
    -TDXAppId 123
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once the script completes, verify on the QA server:

```powershell
# Check IIS Application Pool is running
Get-WebAppPool -Name "PASCO-TDX-MCP" | Select-Object Name, State

# Verify Node.js is listening on localhost:3000
netstat -ano | Select-String ":3000"

# Check Virtual Application is configured
Get-WebApplication -Name "PASCO-TDX-MCP" -Site "Default Web Site"

# Verify .env file exists
Test-Path "E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP\.env"
```

### Step 4: Test Connectivity

From your machine:

```powershell
# Test HTTPS access to the MCP server
$url = "https://qa-dmz-server.domain.local/PASCO-TDX-MCP/"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -SkipCertificateCheck -UseBasicParsing
```

Should return HTTP 200 if the server is responding.

## Troubleshooting

### WinRM Connection Failed
- Verify WinRM is enabled on QA server: `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`
- Check firewall allows WinRM (ports 5985/5986) from your machine's IP
- Verify credentials are correct (DOMAIN\username and password)
- Test connectivity: `Test-WSMan -ComputerName qa-dmz-server.domain.local -Credential (Get-Credential)`

### Node.js Not Starting
RDP to QA server and check:

```powershell
# Test npm start manually
cd E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP
npm start

# Check for errors in console
# If errors appear, fix them and try again
```

### IIS Returns 502 Bad Gateway
Indicates Node.js isn't listening on localhost:3000:

```powershell
# Check Node process is running
Get-Process -Name node

# Check port 3000
netstat -ano | Select-String ":3000"

# If not listening, Node.js may have crashed - check .env file and npm logs
```

### .env File Permissions Error
Check file permissions:

```powershell
icacls "E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP\.env"

# Should show only admin/system access, NOT world-readable
```

### TDX API Connection Failed
Verify from QA server:

```powershell
# Test connectivity to TDX
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName yourorg.teamdynamix.com -Port 443

# Check .env file has correct credentials
Get-Content "E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP\.env"

# Check Node logs (may appear in Event Viewer)
Get-EventLog Application -Source "npm*" -Newest 10 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Redeployment

To redeploy after code changes:

1. Commit and push code to repository
2. Run the deployment script again: `.\scripts\deploy-local.ps1`

The script will:
- Rebuild the project locally
- Stop the running Node.js process on QA
- Copy new artifacts
- Restart the service

## Rollback

If something goes wrong, the QA server backup is at `E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP.backup`:

```powershell
# On QA server:
Stop-Process -Name node -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP" -Recurse -Force
Copy-Item "E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP.backup" -Destination "E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP" -Recurse
cd E:\Websites\PASCO-TDX-MCP
npm start
```
